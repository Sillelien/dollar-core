## You can override the following properties by creating
## a 'local.properties' configuration file.

## Version information. Set 'snapshot' to false if you are building
## a release.
version=1.2
snapshot=true
debug=true

## Location of an older build of Cofoja, for bootstrapping
## purposes. Leave unset to use a newly built binary.
# bootstrap.jar=build/bootstrap.jar

## Location of dependency JAR files needed to build Cofoja. The
## defaults assume the JAR files are in the 'build' subdirectory,
## except for 'tools.jar', which is probably not what you want.
#asm.jar=build/asm.jar
#junit.jar=build/junit.jar
tools.jar=${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar

## If you use Maven, the following may help, instead.
maven.repo.dir=${user.home}/.m2/repository
# asm.jar=${maven.repo.dir}/asm/asm-all/3.3.1/asm-all-3.3.1.jar
# junit.jar=${maven.repo.dir}/junit/junit/4.8.2/junit-4.8.2.jar
